# Data Science Web App with Streamlit and Python

Welcome to my project on building a data science web app using Streamlit and Python! This project is based on a hands-on course aimed at creating interactive web applications.

## Objectives

1. **Build interactive web applications with Streamlit and Python**
2. **Use pandas for data manipulation in data science workflows**

## What I Learned

- Building a data science web app with Streamlit
- Loading, exploring, visualizing, and interacting with data
- Creating dashboards with Python code

## Project Structure

### Tasks

1. **Load the Motor Vehicle Collisions Data**
2. **Visualize Data on a Map**
3. **Filtering Data and Interactive Tables**
4. **Plot Filtered Data on a 3D Interactive Map**
5. **3D Interactive Map (continued)**
6. **Charts and Histograms**
7. **Select Data Using Dropdowns**

### Running the App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Conclusion

I built a functional data science web app with Streamlit and Python, enabling data loading, visualization, and interaction.
